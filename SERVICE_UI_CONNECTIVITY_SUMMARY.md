## 🔍 Root Causes

### 1. Navigation Gap
**Problem:** Components exist but aren't linked in dashboard navigation.

**Evidence:**
- Admin dashboard only shows overview, no access to tools
- Client dashboard missing links to SEO, Metaverse, Wallet
- No sidebar or tabs to access advanced features

**Impact:** Users don't know features exist

### 2. Service-Component Disconnect
**Problem:** Services exist but components don't use them.

**Evidence:**
- Mining components use mock data instead of API
- WebSocket service exists but not integrated
- Real-time updates not working

**Impact:** Features appear to work but show fake data

### 3. Incomplete API Implementation
**Problem:** Some backend APIs partially implemented.

**Evidence:**
- Wallet API routes defined but incomplete
- Automation has scripts but no API layer
- LDOM Economy service has no backend

**Impact:** Frontend can't function even if connected

### 4. Design System Fragmentation
**Problem:** Old and new components using different systems.

**Evidence:**
- 4 components use Material Design 3
- 30+ components use legacy designs
- 9 duplicate dashboard components exist

**Impact:** Inconsistent UX, maintenance nightmare
