# npm resolution error report

While resolving: lightdom@1.0.0
Found: ethers@6.15.0
node_modules/ethers
  ethers@"^6.15.0" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peer ethers@"^5.0.0" from @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@2.2.3
node_modules/@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
  @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@"*" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
