# Research Memory Integration - Cascade AI Development Workflow

## How I Use Research Memory in Development

As Cascade AI, I now have a comprehensive research memory system that stores and retrieves insights across multiple domains. Here's how I integrate this into my development workflow:

### üß† Memory-Driven Development Process

#### 1. Research & Learning Phase
```bash
# Store new research findings
npm run research:store

# Load comprehensive research database
npm run research:load

# Review stored insights
npm run research:summary
```

#### 2. Contextual Analysis Phase
```bash
# Analyze project requirements
npm run cascade:analyze

# Retrieve relevant research insights
node research-memory-storage.js retrieve ai_optimization transformers

# Apply memory-driven optimization
npm run cascade:workflow
```

#### 3. Implementation Phase
```bash
# Use research-backed task management
npm run dev:memory

# Execute parallel workflows with memory optimization
npm run cascade:parallel

# Store implementation insights
node research-memory-storage.js store development_methodology "Parallel Execution Patterns"
```

#### 4. Learning & Optimization Phase
```bash
# Analyze workflow performance
npm run cascade:memory

# Store performance insights
node research-memory-storage.js store performance_analytics "Workflow Efficiency Metrics"

# Generate optimization recommendations
npm run research:summary
```
