## Issues Identified

### Design System Fragmentation
1. **Multiple Design Systems**
   - Three separate design system files (DesignSystem, EnhancedDesignSystem, NewDesignSystem)
   - Inconsistent usage across components
   - Need to consolidate into single source of truth

2. **Hardcoded Values**
   - Many components use hardcoded colors/spacing
   - Not using design tokens consistently
   - Direct hex colors instead of semantic tokens

3. **Incomplete MD3 Implementation**
   - NewDesignSystem.tsx has MD3 tokens but not fully implemented
   - Missing state layers on many components
   - Typography scales not consistently applied
   - Elevation system not used properly

### Accessibility Gaps
1. **Color Contrast**
   - Need to audit all text colors for 4.5:1 ratio
   - UI components need 3:1 minimum contrast

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Some components missing keyboard support
   - Focus indicators inconsistent
   - Need to test all interactive elements

3. **ARIA Attributes**
   - Missing labels on some inputs
   - Error messages not properly announced
   - Loading states need ARIA attributes

### Responsive Design
1. **Mobile Support**
   - Some components not responsive
   - Touch targets may be too small (<44px)
   - Need to test all breakpoints

2. **Layout Issues**
   - Fixed widths in some components
   - Overflow issues on mobile
   - Need mobile-first approach throughout

### Dark Mode
1. **Incomplete Implementation**
   - Some components don't have dark variants
   - Images/icons not theme-aware
   - Need to test all states in dark mode

2. **Theme Switching**
   - No theme switcher UI visible
   - Theme preference not persisted
   - No smooth theme transitions

### Performance
1. **Bundle Size**
   - Large component imports
   - Not using code splitting effectively
   - Need tree shaking optimization

2. **Render Performance**
   - Some components re-render unnecessarily
   - Missing memoization
   - Need to profile and optimize
