# Triage: src/components/BeautifulAdminDashboard.tsx

Summary
-------
This file appears in the top TypeScript error list. The usual causes in this repo for UI dashboards are:

- Design system token mismatches (spacing, colors, typography)
- Ant-design icon import issues (named vs default import)
- Incorrect JSX prop types or missing children types

Observed / Likely errors
------------------------
- TS2304 / TS2339: Unknown design token or property access on `Theme` objects.
- TS2614 / TS2724: `@ant-design/icons` doesn't export the named icon referenced.
- TS2345: Props passed into child components don't match declared prop types.

Low-risk fixes
-------------
1. Add small compatibility re-exports in `src/styles/` for renamed design tokens.
2. Replace named icon imports with default-path imports from the `@ant-design/icons` package, or rely on the shim until proper icon packages are aligned.
3. Make props optional where appropriate or update the call sites to provide the required prop shapes. Prefer adding type-safe adapters in `src/components/ui/`.

Next steps
----------
- Implement compatibility re-exports and re-run `npm run type-check`.
- If many icons cause errors, consider creating a single `src/utils/icons.ts` that centralizes imports and can be updated in one place.
