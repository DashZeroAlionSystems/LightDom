auto_execution_mode: 3
---

1. **Pattern Detection**
   - Scan for ML framework imports (tensorflow, torch, sklearn, keras)
   - Monitor file changes in ML-related directories
   - Detect neural network training scripts or model files
   - Identify data preprocessing or feature engineering code

2. **Task Analysis**
   - Parse commit messages for ML-related keywords
   - Check PR descriptions for data science requirements
   - Monitor issue creation with ML or AI tags
   - Detect when working on neural network features

3. **Research Activation**
   - Trigger data-science-research-workflow.md when patterns match
   - Query current ML best practices and recent advancements
   - Research framework-specific optimizations and techniques

4. **Context Gathering**
   - Analyze current ML implementation in LightDom
   - Identify integration points with existing architecture
   - Determine research focus areas based on current work

5. **Knowledge Application**
   - Apply research findings to current implementation
   - Update code with latest best practices
   - Document findings in project memories

6. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Set up file watchers for ML-related changes
   - Monitor for new ML research papers and framework updates
   - Update research triggers based on team usage patterns

7. **Integration Updates**
   - Modify existing workflows to include research activation
   - Update memory creation rules for ML findings
   - Enhance dashboard components with research insights
