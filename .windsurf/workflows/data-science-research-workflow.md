1. **Task Detection**
   - Monitor for data science/neural network related keywords in task descriptions
   - Identify when working with ML models, training data, or neural architectures
   - Check for imports of ML libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)

2. **Research Activation**
   - Automatically trigger when detected patterns match
   - Query current state-of-the-art practices and methodologies
   - Review recent papers, frameworks, and tools

3. **Knowledge Synthesis**
   - Synthesize findings into actionable insights for LightDom
   - Focus on neural network optimization, training efficiency, and deployment
   - Identify integration opportunities with existing LightDom architecture

4. **Implementation Patterns**
   - Document best practices for model training workflows
   - Create patterns for data preprocessing and feature engineering
   - Establish monitoring and evaluation methodologies

5. **Integration Opportunities**
   - Identify how neural networks can enhance existing LightDom features
   - Research edge cases and optimization opportunities
   - Document API integration patterns for ML services

6. **Continuous Updates**
   - Set up periodic research refresh cycles
   - Monitor for breaking changes in ML frameworks
   - Track performance benchmarks and optimization techniques

7. **Workflow Triggers**
   - File changes in neural network related directories
   - Modifications to ML training scripts or configurations
   - Updates to data processing pipelines
   - Changes to model evaluation or deployment code

8. **Memory Integration**
   - Create memories for significant findings and patterns
   - Update existing ML-related memories with new insights
   - Link research findings to specific LightDom use cases
