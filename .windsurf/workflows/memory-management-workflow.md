1. **Memory Creation Trigger Check**
   - Review current task against memory automation rules
   - Identify if new patterns, solutions, or conventions were discovered
   - Determine if solution has reusable value for future development

2. **Memory Content Structuring**
   - Extract key technical insights and patterns
   - Include code examples and implementation details
   - Tag with relevant categories (api, components, architecture, performance, etc.)
   - Link to related existing memories

3. **Memory Validation**
   - Ensure content is concise but comprehensive
   - Verify tags are specific and actionable
   - Confirm memory adds value beyond existing documentation
   - Test memory retrieval relevance

4. **Memory Integration**
   - Update related memories if information overlaps
   - Cross-reference with design system and architecture docs
   - Link to workflow files that might consume this memory

5. **Memory Maintenance**
   - Review memory relevance periodically
   - Update outdated technical details
   - Consolidate related memories when appropriate
   - Archive obsolete patterns

6. **Memory Workflow Enhancement**
   - Document patterns that benefit from memory automation
   - Create templates for common memory types
   - Establish memory review cycles
   - Build memory-driven development practices
