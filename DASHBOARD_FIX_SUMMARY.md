# Dashboard Issues Fixed

## Problems Identified

1. **Dashboard Too Wide** - The AdminDashboard was stretching across the entire viewport
2. **No Real Data** - AdminDashboard was showing static/mock data instead of fetching from API

## Issues with Crawler Data

The crawler is saving data to `crawled_sites` table, but many columns are NULL because:
- The database schema has been modified with additional columns (urls_discovered, urls_crawled, space_saved, status, etc.)
- The crawler is only saving to the original columns defined in the schema
- There's a mismatch between the crawler code and the actual database structure

## Solutions Needed

### 1. Fix Dashboard Width
Add proper container constraints to limit dashboard width:

```tsx
<Card style={{ 
  maxWidth: '1400px', 
  margin: '0 auto',
  marginTop: '20px' 
}}>
```

### 2. Make Dashboard Fetch Real Data
Replace static data with API calls to:
- `/api/crawler/stats` - Real crawler statistics
- `/api/metaverse/mining-data` - Real mining data
- `/api/admin/stats` - Admin statistics

### 3. Update Crawler to Save All Fields
Check the actual database columns and ensure the INSERT statement includes all fields.

## Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Fixed navigation in LandingPage
2. ✅ Added real navigation handlers
3. ✅ Fixed backend syntax errors
4. ⏳ Need to: Update AdminDashboard to fetch real data from API
5. ⏳ Need to: Add width constraints to dashboard
6. ⏳ Need to: Update crawler to save data to ALL database columns

## Next Steps

Run these commands to see actual database structure:

```bash
# Connect to database and check actual columns
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d dom_space_harvester -c "\d crawled_sites"
```

Then update the crawler's INSERT statement to include all columns.

## Current Status

- ✅ App is running (Electron + Vite dev server)
- ✅ Backend API is responding on port 3001
- ✅ Crawler is running and saving data
- ⚠️ Dashboard is too wide and showing mock data
- ⚠️ Database has extra columns that aren't being populated
